# spiderWatchFace

I made this watch face for the Ticwatch Pro 3 becuase I was super annoyed that the normal software wouldn't let me change the background image.

This watch face also overrides ambient mode so that I can have an always on image (the second counting hand is removed).

Battery life is pretty good, I'm able to get more than 16 hours with light use (conncted to an iPhone).

Also this is done on Android Studio becuase the Tic Watch does not support the newer Wear OS watch face's software.

Inspiration taken from my Apple Watch OS design and this article https://hackaday.com/2022/06/27/developing-a-custom-wearos-watch-face/
